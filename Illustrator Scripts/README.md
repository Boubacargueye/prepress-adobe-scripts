Illustrator Scripts
===================

Known Issue
-----------

* EditText units validator is unstable, entering operator like `+` will crash the app.
* `Links/Relink *` - In document with large number of artboards scattered through multiple row positions, only first row of selection is detected.
* `Impose/*` - When artboards exceed canvas size, units will break causing oversized `PlacedItem`.
