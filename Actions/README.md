# Keyboard Shortcuts

This is made possible by using Actions feature which binds Fn keys to menu item.
However, they need to be setup manually:
1. In Actions panel, select `Load Actions...`.
2. Navigate to local Adobe installation path, and find `Actions` directory under `Presets`.
3. Open a file named `Prepress Adobe Script`.
