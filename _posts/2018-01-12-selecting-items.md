`Select` sub-directories contain several scripts to manipulate selection, all of which works under 2 scenarios:
1. When there are no selection, the scripts will scan all items and select ones with matched criteria.
2. When there are selection, the scripts will instead filter current items and deselect ones with unmatched criteria.
