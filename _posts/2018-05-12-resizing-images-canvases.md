Common images operation.

## Resize Images

![Resize all images.](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/prepress-adobe-scripts/raw/assets/screenshots/psd_images_resizeimages.png)

Works exactly like `Menubar > Images > Resize Image` but targets all documents.

## Resize Canvases

![Resize all canvases.](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/prepress-adobe-scripts/raw/assets/screenshots/psd_images_resizecanvases.png)

Works exactly like `Menubar > Images > Resize Canvas` but targets all documents.
